# Welcome to SecureCode IDE

Start coding in a secure, sandboxed environment with AI assistance.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new file in the `src/` directory
2. Write your code with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
3. Click "Run" to execute in a secure sandbox
4. Use the AI assistant to explain, test, or refactor your code

## Security

All code runs in an isolated environment with:
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- No network access by default
- Read-only file system
- Audit logging

Happy coding! ðŸš€
